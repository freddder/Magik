# OpenGL Pokémon Game

This is a personal project I work on my free time. My objective is to create a Pokémon game from scratch. From everything from rendering to gameplay logic. Although I hope to make this into a full game on day, my main objective is to improve as a programmer.

Current technologies:
- OpenGL + glad for rendering
- Assimp for model loading
- Rapidjson for level loading

# Prerequisites
- C++ Redistributables

# How to run
1. Open Visual Studio 2022
2. Select Debug or Release as the configuration and x64 as the platform
3. Run the project
