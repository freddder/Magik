# Magik Engine

This is a personal project I work on my free time. My objective is to create a Pok√©mon game from scratch. From everything from rendering to gameplay logic. Although I hope to make this into a full game on day, my main objective is to improve as a programmer.

Current technologies:
- OpenGL + glfw for rendering
- Assimp for model loading
- Rapidjson for json read/write
- Freetype for font loading
- Tracy for profiling
